# Post-processing and visualization

MET post-processing and visualization systems are primarily used for
small and large scale serial- and parallel processing tasks. In order
to post- or reprocess modeldata or to visualize 2D/3D data remotely,
MET relies on state-of-the are technology.

To achieve the maximum throughput and to handle the huge amounts of
parallel I/O operations Researcher and Meteorologists at MET benefit
of low latency and high bandwidth networks and highly parallel storage
systems We ensure data integrity by checksumming network traffic and
on disk data.

To enable remote sites and airports to access (weather) data on demand
and independent from your location we are providing a remote 2D/3D
visualization service.
