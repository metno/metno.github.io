## Security clearance

As part of the public administration, some MET positions require a security clarence. Please read more about clarence at [NSM Web pages](https://www.nsm.stat.no), especially the [frequently asked questions page](http://goo.gl/0QCFBH) - Google translated for your convenience.

Short summary:
1 Norwegian citizens are eligible for security clearance
2 Citizens of NATO countries, and citizens of countries Norway extends a great deal of trust are eligible for a security clearance
3 Citizens of countries where person inquiry responses does not in general meet with required standards of trust, an applicant might never obtain a Norwegian security clearance, or the clarence process may take several years to conclude
4 If investigations of your person record evaluated to not comply with clearance requirements you may be denied clarence regardless of your citizenship

If you belong to category 3 or 4, and the position require security clearance, we will discourage you from applying for the position.

If you belong to category 1 or 2 we encourage you to go forth with your application.
